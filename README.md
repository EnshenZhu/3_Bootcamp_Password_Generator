## <li>Project Purpose
<p>
    This project is going to build up a webpage to generate a random password by users' preference on the password length, whether including uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number and special characters. The password length limit is between 8 chars to 128 chars (both included). You can find a detailed rubric for this work in the Section <a href=#Work_Rubrik> "Work Rubrick".</a>
